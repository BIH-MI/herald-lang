# HERALD - Lang

## About HERALD

HERALD stands for Human-centric Extraction for Research and Analysis of Longitudinal Data. It is a specialized query language designed to empower medical researchers in analyzing longitudinal health data. The core aim of HERALD Lang is to facilitate the extraction and aggregation of data into cross-sectional tables for statistical analyses. The design of HERALD's syntax is intuitive, closely mirroring natural language to enhance user accessibility and efficiency. The prototype implementation consists of a HERALD excecution engine, combined with a  graphical query editor, and paired with analytics functionalities to showcase the capabilities of the HERALD query language. 

This repository houses the core functionalities of HERALD.

## Repository Contents

- `herald-lang`: This module forms the backbone of the HERALD query language. It encompasses the language's grammar, parser, and lexer, providing the essential components that define and interpret HERALD's syntax and commands.

- `herald-ui`: This component is dedicated to the user interface aspects of HERALD. It includes an intuitive graphical query editor, facilities for query binding, and tools for browsing and interacting with concept hierarchies, all designed to enhance the user experience in constructing and visualizing queries.

- `ghdm-data`: This module incorporates the generic data model integral to HERALD and supports various data loading and wrangling functionalities.

- `ghdm-ui`: This module houses additional UI elements, such as cohort selection and various modals.
